### Projects

#### Data Analysis in Excel: Spreadsheets to Calculate and Visualize Trends

Initial Project Idea:
I wanted to make a well-functioning spreadsheet that could organize, calculate, and graph data trends for a small brand with limited inventory.

Tools I used:
I used Microsoft Excel to build the spreadsheet, format tables, create formulas for automatic calculations, and generate visual graphs.

Challenges I Faced:
One challenge I faced while doing this project was setting up the correct formulas and making sure everything ran smoothly. I was able to resolve the issue by testing different formulas and using Excel's built-in formula auditing tools.

Other resources:
I also watched a few videos about how to navigate through Excel and sought help from fellow classmates.

Result:
I was able to create a spreadsheet that provided a simplified data analysis of items sold by the owner as well as how much inventory was in stock.

Summary:
This project allowed me to use Excel to format and visualize, organize, and identify trends within data. I made sure to make the graphs, data, and formulas to be near and easy to read.
